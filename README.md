## Overview
A small job was carried out for an investor where the idea is to set up an ice cream business in Hawaii, the problem is that the investor is asking us to do a climate analysis in that area, since he had bad experiences with this issue in various businesses that led him to close them. So he is asking us for two specific months that he wants to analyze, June and December

## Resources
Sofware : Sqlite, Jupyter, Python


## Results
- The average temperature for the month of June is 74.9, and the average temperature for December is 71.04, which gives a difference of 3.86 degrees.

- The maximum temperature that arrives in June is 85, while the maximum temperature in December is 83, so the differences are only 2 degrees for their maximum values.

- The difference between the minimum temperature of both months is the largest that exists between the values ​​to be analyzed, since the minimum temperature that occurs in the month of June is 64 and the minimum temperature that occurs in the month of December is of 56, the difference between both months is 8 degrees

## Summary

We were exclusively asked to do an analysis of the months of June and December to have a slight expectation of how the temperature of Hawaii would behave during the year, only that when seeing the results they may be a bit misleading, since As we could see, within the average temperature and the maximum temperatures of both months. These did not vary much, the problem was when the minimum temperatures were analyzed, since a difference of 8 degrees is something big, but in the same way it is logical to think since one month is summer and the other is winter, the best that could be To do it would be to graph both months to see the distribution that has its temperatures throughout the month, it would also be good to carry out the same information searches but within the following months, thus to be able to monitor even more the behavior of the temperature and the climate during the year and be able to make the best decisions.
 
Also another search that should be done is about the precipitation between these months, since one of the examples that our investor was worried about was that due to rain problems he had to close a business, so for his peace of mind and ours the best thing would be to do an analysis about this issue.
